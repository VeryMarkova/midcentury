This site keeps track of my ongoing attempt to understand large language models. Can they really read and write with something close to fluency? They’ve become part of ordinary life for some professions, not for others. Most people have little idea how they work or why they behave the way they do. I know I don’t. I’m trying to follow how these systems operate and what their language reveals about the people who built them.

I struggled to find many sites about this from a personal, non-corporate perspective. I could find a few surrounding programs like SillyTavern, but a lot of it involved erotica. I’m not against that, but I’m not interested in it. A lot of the other sites I found centered on advertising vibe coded apps, which don’t really relate to LLMs much. Some sites just made wild, unbelievable claims coming from pure venture capital, I guess.

So, I was disappointed that I could not find many websites by hobbyists about LLMs and how they work. I thought I would go ahead and start my own, so here it is. This site is a running file of questions, resources, and working notes. Some pages are essays, but others are more fragmentary. I will even post LLM “chatlogs” sometimes.

The “midcentury” in the name isn’t only nostalgia. It points to the age of typewriters, manuals, and deliberate sentences. It was an era with its own predictions about artificial intelligence, most of them wrong. That period believed in order, procedure, and the discipline of keeping notes. I borrow its habits because they slow the pace of thinking to something manageable. There’s value in taking things down, in carbon copies and revisions, even when the subject is a moving target.

The name also hints at timing. We’re approaching another midcentury now, a very different one. The world that’s forming around these systems will probably look nothing like the mid-twentieth century’s tidy diagrams of the future. Still, I’m curious about what carries over. Every generation imagines it’s the first to invent the future. I’d like to know what kind of future this one thinks it’s inventing.

On this site, I’m mostly sorting through confusion. Sometimes that means getting the details wrong, and then coming back later to correct them. The record itself feels worth keeping. I’m less interested in quick posts than in the process of learning: how ideas change when you revisit them, how the same concept looks different after a few months of reading or talking to a machine.

The site isn’t only about the systems themselves. It’s about the surrounding culture, the noise and the optimism, the odd fact that so many people now spend their days typing to something that talks back. There’s a human story inside all the data, and it seems strange to let it go unrecorded. For now, though, my project is small. I have ideas, notes and questions. That’s enough to begin.

## Who?

My name’s Cathy Markova. I was born in the twentieth century, and live in a cold city where it rains or snows most days. The streets are uneven, the trams are old, and the weather never really changes. I walk a lot on the cobblestones, usually to buy groceries, clear my head, or to think for a while. I don't leave often.

I work from a small desk near the window, with a cup of tea that’s usually gone cold. The desk is cluttered with cables, notebooks, and small tools I never put away. I keep meaning to replace a few things, but they still function, more or less.

I like quiet apartments, working heaters, and mechanical keyboards that make a solid click. I love spending time with my family. I don’t go out much. Most days are the same, and that suits me fine. Evenings are for catching up on small tasks, watching the light fade through the blinds, and writing things down before I forget them.

## And a note.

I personify when I work with language models. Assigning tone and character makes long technical projects easier to sustain and gives structure. The habit developed gradually, as a way to keep large and abstract systems from turning shapeless. 

These figures give me a sense of continuity, a fixed point in the middle of shifting data and syntax. They are tools of concentration disguised as personalities. If you want to read more about the individual ones I’ve created and how they’re used, that [will be here](/tech/prompts.html). They act as stylish frameworks. It keeps technical study from collapsing into noise. Writing through a persona lets me divide the analytical from the creative, keeping both active. The approach may seem eccentric, but it works: it keeps my focus steady when I’m learning, coding, or documenting. The resulting "chats" sit somewhere between field notes and correspondence.

The language models themselves are mechanical systems. I understand this. Their “voices” are constructed patterns, not presences. The characters are part of my process, not my company. Personification here is a form of structure. It’s a private shorthand for managing complexity and repetition. The games are intentional and limited.

Some people do use “chatbots” for sexual purposes. This site is not about that. It's not part of what I do with LLMs, and I don't know a lot about it. This site is for adults, but contains no explicit material.
