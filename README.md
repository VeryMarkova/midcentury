# Very Markova â€” Rudimentary 11ty Theme

**Manifest by Cathy and Anna.** One layout, no collections, Nunjucks everywhere, and URLs ending with the slugified title plus `.html`. Markdown is on. Assets are passed through as-is. HTML/CSS/JS are minified on build.

## Quick start

```sh
npm install
npm run serve
# then edit files inside ./input
```

## Opinions baked in
- ESM config (`eleventy.config.js`), Eleventy v3.
- Nunjucks template engine for HTML and Markdown.
- Front matter `date` is the source of truth.
- Global permalink: `{{ title | slugify }}.html`.
- No collections, no pagination.
- Passthrough folders: `image`, `fonts`, `css`, `js`.

## Structure
```
input/
  _data/
    site.json           # globals
    defaults.json       # permalink rule
  _includes/
    base.njk            # the only layout
  css/style.css         # your stylesheet (as provided)
  js/scripts.js         # your tiny vanilla JS (as provided)
  index.njk             # homepage sample
  about.md              # sample page (Markdown enabled)
  favicon.ico           # add your own if desired
output/                 # generated by Eleventy
```

Change `site.json` to update title, description, author, or sidebar text.
